# US Educational Data by State and County

## About

This project is intended to use statistical datasets that can visually represent the rate in which certain educational levels have been achieved. The goal is to integrate a data visualization framework that can dynamically interpret the information into a web page depending on what option the user wants to see.

The main basic functional aspect I am aiming for is to have a search interface. This way if a user wants to only see information for the state of Kansas, or perhaps wanted to see how many instances there are of a 'Jackson County' within the country, then the search tool interface should be able to provide this in a textual format. This can also be useful to someone who may want to quickly read something specific or may be unable to read a map.


Since people usually appreciate visualizing data in a more artistic format, the bigger visual aspect being aimed for on top of having searchable information is to have this information interpreted into an SVG image map that can use colors and mapping to form a comprehensive understanding of how educational levels are spread throughout the country. This information can allow the end user to make assertations about other correlations that could possibly stem from this information, or perhaps just be all the wiser for knowing.
